# Nautical NavAR - SwampHacks 2020

Nautical NavAR is an augmented reality app that helps guests navigate on-board a cruise ship. It uses AR targets to determine a guest's position, as opposed to GPS which is problematic to use for positioning on a cruise ship due to being constantly moving. After selecting a desired destination, it then overlays directions.
